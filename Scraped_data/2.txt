Another entry for the catalog of fabricated tweets from Twitter’s CEO Elon Musk: one in which he allegedly says he will buy The Joint Commission, an organization that accredits health care programs. 
"Next I’m going to buy Joint Commission and let nurses have drinks at their station," reads what looks like a screenshot of an April 2022 Musk tweet.
A Facebook post sharing it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)
The tweet doesn’t appear in Musk’s feed, nor did he appear to have tweeted and deleted it — we found no news coverage or other credible sources to corroborate that he made such a statement. 
Other purported Musk tweets that weren’t: him saying the world is flat; saying Democrats paid Twitter’s former CEO millions to delete people’s accounts; and saying he’s buying Snapchat. 
We rate claims that this is an authentic Musk tweet False.
